## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository (https://www.github.com/pjedra96/yt-to-mp3) to a directory of your choice.
2. Ensure that you have Python 3 installed on your device (ideally version 3.7.9 for optimal results).
3. It is likely that you may not have all the required libraries installed. It is recommended to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the files listed in the requirements.txt file.
4. Navigate to the main folder, where `main.py` is and either double click it to run, or navigate to the folder in the CMD/terminal and execute the following command `python main.py`.
